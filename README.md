## 📋 Overview
**Week Planner** (code-named *Planned Weak*) is a powerful, offline-first weekly task management application. Unlike generic todo lists, it enforces a "Vision First" philosophy—requiring you to define your major weekly goals before you can dive into daily tasks. It combines clean aesthetics with advanced productivity features like streaks, focus mode, and sub-tab organization.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎯 "Vision First" Planning
- **The Lock Mechanism:** Days are locked until you define at least 3 major weekly objectives. This prevents "busy work" without a clear direction.
- **Dynamic Goals:** Review and edit your weekly vision at any time to stay aligned.

### ⚡ Advanced Task Management
- **Super Add (Multi-line):** Add multiple tasks at once by using commas or new lines. The app intelligently splits and organizes them instantly.
- **Role-Based Organization (Sub-Tabs):** Create custom categories (e.g., *Work, Study, Health, Personal*) to keep your roles separated and organized.
- **Drag-and-Drop:** Intuitive reordering of tasks to adjust priorities on the fly.
- **Auto-Clamp:** Long task descriptions are automatically collapsed for a cleaner UI, with "Show More" options.

### 🔥 Momentum & Consistency
- **Streak System:** A gamified counter that tracks your daily interaction. Reach milestones (5, 10, 25, 50, 100 days) to trigger celebratory confetti effects.
- **Focus Mode:** A specialized view that dims and blurs everything except "Today," helping you eliminate distractions and dominate the present moment.

### 📝 Integrated Notebook
- **Multi-Tab Notebook:** A persistent scratchpad for each week where you can store meeting notes, ideas, or long-form thoughts without cluttering your task list.

### 📈 Detailed Analytics & Reports
- **Daily Evaluation:** Automatically calculates your success percentage and assigns a grade (A, B, C...) based on task completion when you "Close the Day."
- **Historical Reports:** Access your entire history organized by year and month. Review past weeks to analyze progress curves and patterns.

### 💾 Data Sovereignty & Automation
- **100% Private:** Your data never touches a server. It is stored locally in your browser (LocalStorage).
- **Auto-Export:** A unique feature for desktop users to automatically save a JSON backup to a local folder daily.
- **Manual Import/Export:** Seamlessly move your entire history between devices or browsers.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Architecture:** Pure Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+). Zero frameworks, zero dependencies.
- **UI/UX:** Modern, GitHub-inspired aesthetics with CSS Variables for theme management.
- **Persistence:** LocalStorage API for fast, browser-based data storage.
- **Responsive Design:** Deeply optimized for both Desktop and Mobile devices.
- **Multilingual:** Native support for Arabic (RTL) and English (LTR).
